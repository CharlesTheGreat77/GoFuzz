  <h1><strong>GoFuzz</strong></h1>
  <p>‚ö° The lightweight, fast, and concurrent fuzzing tool for web application testing ‚ö°</p>
</div>


GoFuzz is a simple yet powerful fuzzing tool written in Go, designed for web application security testing. With its concurrent execution model, GoFuzz can fuzz endpoints, parameters, and headers efficiently, making it a perfect companion for penetration testers and bug hunters.

# ‚ú® Features:

* Blazing Fast: Leverages Go's concurrency to run multiple requests in parallel.
* Customizable: Supports custom headers, wordlists, and request bodies.
* Flexible Filtering: Filter results by status codes or response contents.
* Lightweight: Minimal dependencies and easy to use.
